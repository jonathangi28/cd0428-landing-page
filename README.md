# Landing Page Project

### Overview

<p>This project is a dynamic web application I worked on as a student at Udacity. The application includes features such as a scroll-to-top button, dynamic menu visibility based on user activity, and smooth scrolling to each section upon link clicks. </p>

### Features

1. **Dynamic Menu Visibility**:
	- The navigation menu bar automatically hides after 5 seconds of inactivity.
	- The menu bar reappears when the user scrolls the page again.
2. **Scroll-to-top Button**:
	- A button that allows users to scroll back to the top of the page smoothly.
	- The button becomes visible when the user scrolls past a certain point on the page.
3. **Anchor Scrolling**:
	- Smooth scrolling to different sections of the page when navigation links are clicked.

### How to Run

1. Fork the repository.
2. Copy the URL of the new repository on your GitHub account.
3. Terminal: ```git clone your-forked-repo-url```
4. Launch the ```index.html``` in your web browser.
